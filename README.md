# Package exchange

**Core idea**: invest your money in npm packages!

Based on my knowledge, a company splits its capital in an 'arbitrary' number of shares. Each shares' value is **capital / # shares**. In my project I assume there are 10,000 'shares' of package download, so the value of each share is **number of package daily download / 10,000**.

The app's main features will be:
- see the value of the balance based on cash and owned shares
- see the transaction list
- buy / sell shares
- see the package's download history
- see the variation of downloads

Future features may be:
- see trending packages
- ... more!
